# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Sanbi, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately by contacting the project maintainer via GitHub.

When reporting, please include:

- A description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- The potential impact

We will review all reports in good faith and aim to respond as quickly as reasonably possible.

## Supported Versions

Sanbi is currently under active development.

Security updates and fixes will generally apply to the latest version of the codebase.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it publicly.

Thank you for helping keep the project and its users safe.
