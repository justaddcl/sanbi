# Contributing to Sanbi

🎉 Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Sanbi**! We welcome feedback, suggestions, bug reports, and improvements. At this time, we want to keep contribution onboarding easy while protecting both you and the project’s future flexibility.

## 👥 How Contributions Work

By submitting a pull request (PR) or issue:

1. You agree that your contribution is being made under the same license as this project — **Apache License 2.0**.
   You grant the project owner a perpetual, irrevocable license to use, modify, distribute, and relicense your contribution as part of Sanbi.

2. You confirm that you have the right to submit your contribution (i.e., it’s your original work or appropriately licensed).

This informal agreement acts as a _lightweight CLA_, helping ensure contributions can be maintained and relicensed if needed without formal paperwork.

> If you prefer not to grant these rights, please discuss alternatives in an issue before submitting a PR.
